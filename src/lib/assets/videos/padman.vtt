00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.240
and so what's your message to the women

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.040
out there who are now breaking glass

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.080
ceilings making headways in a lot of

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.360
areas and men were dominating and even

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.920
to men to actually go out there and

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.719
support women because you've done so

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.020
much that's what I told while I'm

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.180
checking the pad when there is no woman

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.279
volunteer I wore the sand report in my

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.500
underwear but where can I go for uterus

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.480
I met an artificial in a rubber bladder

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.820
I feel animal blood I did for two three

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.640
weeks but it looks unnatural but I

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.340
realized a secret decode a secret from a

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.980
guard out of using the wheat centiped in

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.020
my underwear for three weeks the

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.000
strongest creature created by God in the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.980
world not an elephant

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.640
not a lion not a tiger the women

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.500
Amen to that thank you for saying that

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.660
and I I just want to understand what

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.340
that experience was like because from

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.379
facing so much criticism from being

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.660
ostracized to now being given Awards now

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.879
being recognized what does that feel

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.160
like for you is it a huge validation so

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.440
humor you're recognizing me you are not

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.899
recognizing your recognizing the women

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.180
menstruation the period yeah it is not a

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.640
taboo it is natural so whenever I am

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.560
getting a colored it is not for me it is

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.540
the cause what I'm doing so that's why

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.939
even that interview I'm not giving to

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.580
you the cause is spreading that's why I

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.460
took Chris to come here so the moment I

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.840
am sitting I'm talking I'm not talking

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.119
about my thing I'm not going to ask the

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.280
vote for my party nothing I am talking

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.420
about women period so give access to the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.979
downturned people especially the girls

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.780
in the studying in the school because

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.939
they're dropping out from school in a

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.900
simple matter not available

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.740
that's what I spoke with Indian Finance

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.320
Minister sir we are talking about making

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.240
two digit GDP growth in our country

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.220
unless otherwise you are bringing our

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.439
women into that Indian Workforce we

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.659
can't make it that's why it happened the

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.360
GST everything you know so because at

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.439
least they have to finish the school

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.119
then they have to get some skill

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.979
training then they will join in the

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.060
Indian Workforce
