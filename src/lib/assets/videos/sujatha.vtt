00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.530
for me mathematics was always

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.700
fascinating because a subject where you

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.320
really didn't need to learn things by

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.869
heart you really had to understand it

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.539
was very passionate about learning and

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.060
doing well in exams but I also had fun I

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.609
was a tomboy and my family was a little

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.449
worried but they encouraged me my area

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.960
is at the intersection of algebra and

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.000
number theory using algebraic techniques

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.789
to study very deep questions in number

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:42.300
theory I had a very good mentor who was

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.160
very understanding of the problems that

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.129
women might face and especially when

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.050
they are passionate about their work and

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.179
they have to be focused on the work-life

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:54.659
balance I've been diagnosed with a form

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:56.820
of brain cancer and I had to undergo

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.829
emergency surgery a couple of years back

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.670
that was the biggest barrier I would say

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.280
seems to be quite common for the male

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.430
groups to hang around together our men

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.990
will just go let's say in the evening

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.310
we'll go for a drink

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.170
and it's an extended form of

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.760
professional communication that would

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.000
seep into this and you're judged as if

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.560
you were part of that professional

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.619
conversation I am a passionate believer

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.560
in diversity at the workplace not just

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.110
in science but in all endeavors if we do

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.840
not have diversity then the problems the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.009
full set of problems are never captured

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.420
in a country like India I find it

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.190
especially disturbing that parents are

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.229
afraid when their daughters do very well

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.509
in school because they see it as a

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.890
possible hindrance to their marriage

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.470
prospects my advice to young girls and

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.289
their parents would be to have full

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:51.780
trust in themselves full confidence you

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.619
know I'm always amazed by how surprised

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.660
people are when a woman speaks about

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.970
science with passion and I want to tell

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.619
them it's the most natural thing it's

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.570
just that women have been given a chance

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.990
to speak about it with passion

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.899

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.959
