hi baby are you a boy or a girl funny

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.599
you should ask sid one of the first

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:13.360
things they check when a new baby is

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.200
born is what kind of body parts they

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.760
have they do that to determine a baby's

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.160
sex most of the time it's easy to

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.480
determine and sometimes it's more

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.680

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.880

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.000
your body looks on the outside is only

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.239
part of the story

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:41.280
what

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.320

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.000
little one

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.079
your sex refers to your physical body

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.239
parts remember but there is also

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.320
something called gender which is how you

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.879
feel inside your body and who you know

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.760
yourself to be and your gender how you

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.320
feel on the inside doesn't always match

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.920
the sex you were called when you were

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.879
born

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.080
okay

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.760
let's say you were born with a penis and

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.240
you feel like a boy inside in that case

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.479
your sex and your gender match well what

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.560
if you were born with a penis and you

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.280
know you're a girl inside not a boy then

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.520
your sex and your gender don't match

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.759
wait what does know you're a girl inside

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:21.680
i mean anyway does that mean you have to

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.640
love pink things and princesses nope

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.640
sometimes people refer to things as girl

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.880
things and boy things but this is just

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.040
how people sometimes classify things

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.200
usually to make it easier to sell stuff

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.240
to kids and their parents clothes toys

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.479
and games are for everyone you don't

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.560
have to be a boy or a girl to like a

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.759
certain thing

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.920
sid has anyone ever told you that you

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.520
shouldn't play with something or wear

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.720
something because you're a boy well

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.280
yes the body parts you were born with

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.000
don't always dictate who you are how you

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.399
feel or what you like to play with

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.200

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.040
yourself to be

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.520

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.239
whole bunch of possibilities figuring

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.000
out what feels right for you is just

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.239
part of growing up
