00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.740
my boys are growing up in a world where

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.570
I don't think they've ever questioned

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.270
whether or not a woman could be a doctor

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.730
or whether or not a man could be a

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.969
dancer they're not assigning roles to

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.639
gender because that's their reality

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.730
but unfortunately outdated stereotypes

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.910
are still very much alive today so we as

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.460
parents need to be raising kids that are

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.910
aware and mindful that just because they

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.949
are not hearing these sort of things on

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.040
a regular basis that they are very real

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:37.820

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.440
one day when my boys were younger we

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.809
went to a popular fast food restaurant

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.030
and the person working the drive-through

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.030
asks me is that for a boy or is it for a

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.120
girl we were quiet in the car and my

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.370
boys are like why does that matter

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.289
so we get to the window and they give us

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.270
these kid meals and it turns out the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.739
reason that they are asking is because

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.100
there are two very specific toy options

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.430
one of which is for boys one of which is

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.580
for girls and my boys did not want that

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.189
toy those for the boy we had to park the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.210
car and go inside to make them give me

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.299
the toy for a girl these conversations

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.570
are important because what they see from

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.220
me and from their mother and from

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.979
society that is going to shape their

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.180
view of gender roles in our home I take

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.130
on a lot of responsibilities that

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.810
previous generations would have scoffed

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.350
at the idea of a man doing laundry and

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.600
dropping off the kids at practice and

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.119
going on field trips and changing

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.060
diapers and conversely my wife she'll

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.670
fix the dryer she'll put in a ceiling

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.680
fan frankly she's better at that than I

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.869
am so why wouldn't she do that for our

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.810
boys to grow up seeing that in action

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.030
and know that it's not staged that it's

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.670
our reality that's going to open them up

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.520
to so many other possibilities I'm not

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.200
saying all you can't ever talk to your

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.990
girls about bunnies if they love bunnies

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.639
you can only talk to them about science

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.649
meet them where they are

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.989
you know and same with boys by no means

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.080
don't want to imply that it's wrong for

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.300
kids to embrace things that they enjoy

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.850
just because it falls on one side or the

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.830
other just that it shouldn't be mandated

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.060
by us kids can be anything girls can be

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.060
strong boys can be strong girls can be

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.400
sensitive boys can be sensitive and

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.640
everybody loves glitter to see kids grow

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.220
up embracing that it makes it for such a

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.830
brighter future a healthier environment

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.490
for everyone

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.619
