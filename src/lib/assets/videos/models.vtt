WEBVTT

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.540
we need the best brains in the country

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:04.830
to be working on financial inclusion

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.010
this can't be one of the last career

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.860
choices that people have it should be

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.750
the first one and when we start having

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.730
more and more people choosing to be in

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.820
these sectors and making this a priority

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:24.810
it will work the biggest contribution as

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.720
a leader is to get them to dream big

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.779
whatever great examples of what a human

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.960
being can achieve she manages extremely

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.129
well being quiet and being passionate

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.920
I'm a finance person I'm hardcore

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.990
finance person you know and one of the

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.270
things I've always wanted to do was just

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.920
really apply this knowledge to areas

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.150
like Financial Inclusion

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.190
Kshama is very very high ethics

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.620
extremely high ethics she's a very

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.440
charismatic person extremely inspiring

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.260
and obviously her knowledge speaks

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.690
volumes this is this is the real India

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.610
on the one hand you have a large

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.260
proportion of Indians who have no access

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.640
to finance and on the other hand you

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.200
have these large and deep pools of

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.060
capital which can provide that access

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.070
and then actually bringing the two of

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.040
them together would solve a lot of the

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.360
problems that we are seeing today and

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.530
that's the role that I have from our

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.770
capital is trying to play I guess I

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.810
think what we want at IFM our capital is

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.270
professionals and as long as people are

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.390
excluded we have a job to do there are

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.360
people who inspire you to be great you

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.210
know to live life and so I think Shama

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.430
is that kind of person this you takes

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.830
care of me and she takes interest in

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.289
making sure that you are able to balance

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:58.220
work and life this is just one word that

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.580
really rings in my mind as to what kind

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.700
of a mom she's been to me and that word

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.039
is supportive if at all I think I'm a

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.139
role model it's a suspect that you can

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.140
actually be full-time CEO of a company

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.230
that is growing at a hundred percent

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.430
year-on-year and despite all of this I

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.300
find the time and I find the need to

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.840
really have a life that goes beyond my

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.940
work no no thank you thank you

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.380
every single thing I do no matter how

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.200
small or big is an experience I live and

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.870
I cherish and I think it's an unending

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.200
game
