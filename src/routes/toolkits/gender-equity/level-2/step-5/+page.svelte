	<p>It is our responsibility to identify these stereotypes and break them What can you do?</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<strong>Learn and Unlearn</strong> : Be aware of stereotypes. Question them. Remember, anyone can
			be anything!
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong> Support Each Other </strong> : Encourage everyone to pursue their passions. Letâ€™s create
			workplaces where talent matters more than old ideas.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong> Use technology as a tool </strong> : You can create Scratch projects and share your experience
			of facing gender stereotypes or represent the changes you want to see around you to raise awareness
			through Scratch!
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>So, letâ€™s unmask these myths and build a more equal work world! ðŸŒŸðŸ˜Š</p>
