<Paper title={'What is a Stereotype ?'}>
	<p>
		Do you remember in Raniâ€™s story how confidently the mother said â€˜Strong boys donâ€™t cryâ€™ when
		Aryan was hurt? Or how Priya casually expressed her thought that maybe subjects like Maths and
		Science are not meant for girls?
	</p>
	<p>
		Do you think these statements were made on the basis of any scientific proof OR were they coming
		purely from societal expectations of how certain things should be?
	</p>
	<p>
		A stereotype is an over-generalised belief about a particular category of people. It is an
		expectation that people might have about every person of a particular group.

		The most common stereotype that affects us most often is the <strong>gender stereotypes</strong
		>. Gender stereotypes are unfair ideas that assign certain characteristics and roles based on
		whether someone is male or female.
	</p>
	<p>But, remember ...</p>
	<p>IT IS IMPORTANT TO EDUCATE OURSELVES ABOUT THESE BELIEFS BECAUSE WE MAKE THE SOCIETY.</p>
