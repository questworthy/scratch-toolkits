	<p>What truly is the meaning of <strong>Equity</strong>?</p>

	<p>
		There are two words that sound very similar to each other <strong>Equity</strong> and
		<strong>Equality</strong> ? Can you tell the difference?
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
				<strong> Equality </strong>
				means each individual or group of people is given the same resources or opportunities.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				<strong>Equity</strong> recognizes that each person has different circumstances and provides
				the exact resources and opportunities needed to reach an equal outcome.
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		This concept applies to almost every sphere of life and not just around gender. Gender equity
		leads to actual gender equality!
