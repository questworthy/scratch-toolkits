			Gender identities- There are multiple gender identities recognised in the world, for ex :
			Agender, androgyne, bigender, cisgender, transgender and more (here is a list of all the
			recognised gender identities: List of gender identities - Wikipedia)
		</li>
		<li>
			Sexual identities are about who we are attracted to romantically or who we might have crushes
			on. Some people might like boys, some might like girls, and some might like both boys and
			girls. Some people might not feel attraction to anyone, and that's okay too. For ex :
			heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual et cetera.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		As you grow up, you might start thinking more about who you are and who youâ€™re attracted to.
		This is a part of understanding your identity.
	</p>

	<p>
		Take care of a few sensitivities while talking to people of different genders. For example, ask
		what pronouns would they want to be called: they/ them/ he/ she.
	</p>

	<p>
		Did you know that multiple genders have existed as part of many ancient communities all around
		the world for centuries.
