	<p>The Scratch game in the previous step educated you about:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			Gender identities- Agender, androgyne, bigender, cisgender, transgender and more (here is a
			list of all the recognised gender identities: List of gender identities - Wikipedia)
		</li>
		<li>
			Sexual identities: Straight or heterosexual, gay/lesbian or homosexual, bisexual, pansexual or
			queer, asexual, or curious about own sexual orientation. Click on this link to learn about the
			sexual identities that the popular information website, Wikipedia, recognises: Sexual identity
			- Wikipedia
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		As you grow up, you might start thinking more about who you are and who youâ€™re attracted to.
		This is a part of understanding your identity.
	</p>

	<p>
		Everyone is unique! Each one of us is unique even if we may have different gender or sexual
		identities. That doesnt make us a wrong/bad person.
	</p>

	<p>
		Take care of a few sensitivities while talking to people of different genders. For example, ask
		what pronouns would they want to be called: they/ them/ he/ she.
	</p>

	<p>
		Did you know that multiple genders have existed as part of many ancient communities all around
		the world for centuries.

			<p>Bugis- Indonesia</p>
			<p>
				The Buginese people are an ethnic group in Indonesia. There are about six million Bugis. The
				Bugis people recognize five different genders. This concept of gender has been part of Bugis
				culture for at least six centuries.

		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Australian Aboriginal- Sistergirl and Brotherboy</p>

			<p>
				A brotherboy is an individual who is assigned female at birth but feels masculine
				spiritually and may take on male roles in the community and/or society. A sistergirl is an
				individual who is assigned male at birth but feels feminine spiritually and may take on
				female roles in the community and/or society. These identities are a cultural and gender
				identity.
